# Frontend PWA Configuration
# ====================================

# Backend API Configuration
# URL to connect to the backend server
# Options:
#   - Empty string '' = use relative URLs (same origin as frontend)
#     This works for both localhost and LAN access automatically
#   - 'http://localhost:3000' = local development
#   - 'http://192.168.x.x:3000' = LAN access to Android Termux server
#   - 'https://your-domain.com' = production deployment
# 
# RECOMMENDED: Leave empty for most use cases (tunnel/LAN/localhost)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Backend Usage Mode
# Set to 'true' to fetch prices from your backend server
# Set to 'false' to fetch directly from CoinGecko API (may hit rate limits)
VITE_USE_BACKEND=true

# Fallback Configuration
# Set to 'true' to automatically fallback to CoinGecko if backend is unreachable
# Set to 'false' to show error when backend fails
VITE_FALLBACK_TO_COINGECKO=true

# Data Synchronization (Portfolio, Wallets, Assets)
# Set to 'true' to enable LAN sync (backend becomes source of truth)
#   - Data syncs between all devices connected to the same backend
#   - Requires backend server running on Android Termux or other device
# Set to 'false' to use local-only storage (data stays on this device)
